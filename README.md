## üìÑ Overview

This project was bootstrapped with **[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)**, a powerful tool for quickly starting modern React applications. It provides a pre-configured development environment, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than build configurations.

This `README.md` serves as a guide to the basic commands and resources related to a project built with CRA.

## ‚ú® Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### ‚öôÔ∏è `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.\
Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.\
You may also see any lint errors in the browser console.

### üß™ `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about **[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)** for more information.

### üì¶ `npm run build`
Builds the app for production into the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes for caching purposes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about **[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)** for more information.

### üöÄ `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!**

If you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) and transitive dependencies directly into your project, giving you full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to tweak them. At this point, you are on your own.

You do not have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium-sized deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, Create React App provides this option for advanced customization when you are ready for it.

## üìö Learn More (About CRA & React)

You can learn more in the **[Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started)**.
